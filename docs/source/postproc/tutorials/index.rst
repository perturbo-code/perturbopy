Tutorials
=========
    
Here, we provide tutorials for Perturbo postprocessing. For each tutorial, we first must perform a Perturbo calculation, described `here <https://perturbo-code.github.io/mydoc_running_perturbo.html>`_. Perturbo offers several *calculation modes*, which compute different properties of a material. The results are outputted to a YAML file, which is used as an input to Perturbopy.

Below, we give general information on how to use Perturbopy. We also provide tutorials for each *calculation mode*:

General information
-------------------

.. _perturbo_calculation:

All Perturbo calculations output a YAML file (default name *'<prefix>_<calc_mode>.yml.'*). This YAML file structure is described on the `Perturbo website <https://perturbo-code.github.io/mydoc_running_perturbo.html#yaml-file-structure>`_. It contains the following information:

* inputs to the Perturbo calculation (the *input parameters* field in the YAML file)
* information about the material (the *basic data* field in the YAML file), such as the lattice parameter and lattice vectors. 
* outputs from the Perturbo calculation (fields that are specific to each ``calc_mode``, described in individual tutorials)

We will use this YAML file to export the data to Python with Perturbopy.

.. _exporting_data:

Exporting data
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The first step is to create a object containing the data. All of the data from the YAML file is stored in Perturbopy objects, which have a datatype specific to their ``calc_mode``. For example, let's say the ``calc_mode`` = ``'bands'``. To postprocess the results, we should create a :py:class:`.Bands` object called ``si_bands``, using the YAML file as an input. The ``si_bands`` object contains all the data stored in the YAML file, *'si_bands.yml'*. 

.. code-block :: python

    import perturbopy.postproc as ppy

    si_bands = ppy.Bands.from_yaml('si_bands.yml')

.. note ::
    Some Perturbo calculation modes output results that are too large to be stored in a YAML file. These results are stored instead in an HDF5 file. If a particular calculation mode requires an HDF5 file, it will be stated in the respective tutorial.

The *basic data* field of the YAML file stores information about the material from the *'prefix'_epr.h5* file generated in the ``qe2pert`` step. Each entry of the *basic data* is stored in separate attributes in the Perturbopy object. For example, here we obtain the lattice parameter (alat) and lattice vectors (lat) used for silicon:

.. code-block :: python

    si_bands.alat

    >> 10.264

    si_bands.lat

    >> array([[-0.5,  0. , -0.5],
              [ 0. ,  0.5,  0.5],
              [ 0.5,  0.5,  0. ]])

For full details on all the *basic data* entries stored as attributes in ``si_bands``, please refer to the parameters of :py:class:`.CalcMode`. 

Perturbo outputs are stored in attributes that are specific to their ``calc_mode``, Please refer to the individual tutorials for more details. Two important databases are used to store :ref:`k-points and q-points <Handling k-points and q-points>`, and to store other :ref:`physical quantities <Physical quantities>` such as band energies, temperatures, etc.

Remaining data from the YAML file are stored in the :py:attr:`.CalcMode._pert_dict` attribute. For example, calculation inputs are stored in the *inputs* field of the :py:attr:`.CalcMode._pert_dict` dictionary in every Perturbopy object.

.. code-block :: python

    si_bands._pert_dict['input parameters']['after conversion']['sampling']

    >> 'uniform'

Perturbo outputs that are not physically relevant (such as timing information and parallelization information) are also stored in :py:attr:`.CalcMode._pert_dict`. 


.. _handling_kpt_qpt:

Handling k-points and q-points
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In several calculation modes, we work with sets of points in reciprocal space, such as k-points and q-points. These are stored in  objects of type :py:class:`.RecipPtDB`. For example, let's look at the ``kpt`` attribute of the :py:class:`.Bands`, which stores the k-points used in the ``bands`` calculation.

The N coordinates are stored as a 3xN array in the :py:attr:`.RecipPtDB.points` attribute of ``kpt``. For example, to access the first k-point:

.. code-block :: python
    
    si_bands.kpt.points[:, 0]

    >> array([0.5, 0.5, 0.5])

The units of :py:attr:`.RecipPtDB.points` can either be:

* *crystal*: coordinates are in relative coordinates of the reciprocal lattice vectors
* *cartesian*: coordinates are in units of :math:`\frac{2\pi}{a}`

To see the units, 

.. code-block :: python
    
    si_bands.kpt.units

    >> 'crystal'

To change the units,

.. code-block :: python
    
    si_bands.kpt.convert_units("cartesian") # returns the converted units
    si_bands.kpt.units

    >> 'cartesian'

The ``kpt`` attribute also stores the k-path coordinates, which are the one-dimensional coordinates assigned to each k-point. These would be the x-coordinates on a plot of the band structure.

.. code-block :: python
    
    si_bands.kpt.path

    >> array([0., 0.0169809, 0.0339618, ... 3.7386444, 3.7594417, 3.780239])

It is also possible to rescale the k-path, which has arbitrary units.

.. code-block :: python
    
    # Rescale the k-path to a range between 0 and 10
    si_bands.kpt.scale_path(0, 10)

    si_bands.kpt.path

    >> array([0., 0.04492018,  0.08984035, ... 9.88996833,  9.94498417, 10.])

The :py:class`.RecipPtDB` dataype also provides methods to:

* search an array of k-points for a particular k-point, and return the indices of the matches (:py:meth:`.RecipPtDB.find`)
* find the k-path coordinate corresponding to a k-point coordinate (:py:meth:`.RecipPtDB.point2path`)
* find the k-point coordinate corresponding to a k-path coordinate (:py:meth:`.RecipPtDB.path2point`)

.. code-block :: python

    # Finds the index or indices of the k-point [0.5, 0.25, 0.75]
    si_bands.kpt.find([0.5, 0.25, 0.75])

    >> array([123], dtype=int64)

    # Check that this index is correct
    si_bands.kpt.points[:, 123]

    >> array([0.5 , 0.25, 0.75])

    # Find the k-path coordinate corresponding to k-point [0.5, 0.25, 0.75]
    si_bands.kpt.point2path([0.5, 0.25, 0.75])

    >> array([6.25893072])

    # Check that this k-path coordinate is correct
    si_bands.kpt.path[123]

    >> 6.258930718401667

    # Do the reverse: convert from k-path coordinate to k-point 
    si_bands.kpt.path2point(6.26)

    >> array([0.5 , 0.25, 0.75])

Note that, in the case of repeated k-points, both indices will be returned:

.. code-block :: python

    # Find the index of the gamma point, which is in the k-points twice
    si_bands.kpt.find([0,0,0])

    >> array([ 51, 195], dtype=int64)

    # Check this result
    si_bands.kpt.points[:, 51]
    si_bands.kpt.points[:, 195]

    >> array([0., 0., 0.])
       array([0., 0., 0.])

Note that all three of these functions take two additional inputs: `max_dist` and `nearest`. The `max_dist` (default 0.025) specifies the maximum distance between two k-points to consider them a match. For example, 

.. code-block :: python

    # Find the index of [0.01, 0.01, 0.01], which is not one of the k-points stored in kpt.points.
    # However, its distance from [0,0,0] is 0.017 < 0.025, so the results for [0, 0, 0] are returned.
    si_bands.kpt.find([0.01, 0.01, 0.01])

    >> array([ 51, 195], dtype=int64)

    # Check this result
    si_bands.kpt.points[:, 51]
    si_bands.kpt.points[:, 195]

    >> array([0., 0., 0.])
    >> array([0., 0., 0.])

If `nearest` (default True) is True, only the k-point(s) that are closest to a requested k-point is considered a match, even if other k-points are within the `max_dist` range. For example, if `max_dist` = 0.05, then both [0.01, 0.01, 0.01] and [0.02, 0.02, 0.02] lie within that distance from [0, 0, 0]. If `nearest` = True, only [0.01, 0.01, 0.01] is considered a match. If `nearest` is False, both are considered matches. 

We can also add labels to the k-points. For example, the FCC Brillouin zone identifies [0.5, 0.5, 0.5] as the L point, and [0.5, 0.0, 0.5] as the X point. To add these labels,

.. code-block :: python
    
    si_bands.kpt.add_labels({"L": [0.5, 0.5, 0.5], "X": [0.5, 0.0, 0.5]})
    si_bands.kpt.labels

    >> {'L': [0.5, 0.5, 0.5], 'X': [0.5, 0.0, 0.5]}

Note these labels can be removed with `kpt.remove_labels`.

.. code-block :: python

    si_bands.kpt.remove_labels(["L"])
    si_bands.kpt.labels

    >> {'X': [0.5, 0.0, 0.5]}

A dictionary of labels for the FCC lattice can be found in ``ppy.lattice.points_fcc``.

.. code-block :: python
    
    si_bands.kpt.add_labels(ppy.lattice.points_fcc)
    si_bands.kpt.labels

    >> {'L': [0.5, 0.5, 0.5],
    >>  'X': [0.5, 0.0, 0.5],
    >>  'W': [0.5, 0.25, 0.75],
    >>  'K': [0.375, 0.375, 0.75],
    >>  '$\\Gamma$': [0, 0, 0]}

.. _physical_quantities:

Physical quantities
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Physical quantities such as energies, temperatures, mobilities, conductivities, etc are stored in :py:class:`UnitsDict` objects. These objects inherit from and function as Python dictionaries. They have an additional attribute to store the units.

For example in ``si_bands``, the band energies are stored in the :py:attr:`.Bands.bands` attribute. This is a :py:class:`UnitsDict`, with keys corresponding to band index and values corresponding to the energies of that band along the k-point path. It functions as a Python dictionary:

.. code-block :: python

    si_bands.bands.keys()
    >> dict_keys([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8])

    si_bands.bands[8]
    >> array([13.69848506, 13.70154719, ..., 9.47676028, 9.46081004])


We can also access the energy units.

.. code-block :: python

    si_bands.bands.units
    >> 'eV'
